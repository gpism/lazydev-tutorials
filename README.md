# 🦥 LazyDev Tutorials  
> A community repo for open-source projects whose original devs were too lazy to explain the basics.

## 🧠 Why LazyDev Exists  

Too many brilliant open-source projects ship with zero usable documentation.  
They work… somehow. But you’ll spend **3 hours reading 12 GitHub issues** just to run a “Hello World.”

LazyDev fixes that.  
We reverse-engineer the “undocumented obvious stuff” — then write **simple, working, reproducible** guides for it.  

> “If you can’t make it work in 10 minutes from the README, the README is broken.”

| **🛠️ Tutorials** | Clear step-by-step setup guides for complex OSS projects. |
| **💡 Examples** | Minimal working snippets that actually run. |
| **⚙️ Environment Notes** | Tested configurations (OS, drivers, versions). |
| **🧩 Troubleshooting** | Quick fixes for the errors you’re guaranteed to hit. |
| **🧃 Lazy TL;DRs** | “Just give me the command” cheat-sheets. |

## 🧃 Writing Style

* **Keep it simple.**
  One concept per section.
* **Show the commands.**
  Don’t just describe — demo.
* **Explain why.**
  Every fix gets a one-line reason.
* **Be funny if you can.**
  Tech is dry — you don’t have to be. 😎
